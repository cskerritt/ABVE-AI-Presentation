## Introduction and Purpose

The goal of this guide is to help anyone—especially beginners—learn how to:

1. **Sign up for an OpenAI account and generate an API key**  
   \- This key allows you to communicate with OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) services.

2. **Install and configure ChatBox, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Microsoft Word**  
   \- These tools will help you convert PDF vocational expert reports into editable text (via Optical Character Recognition or OCR), remove personal information, and critically analyze the content.

3. **Perform OCR on PDF vocational expert reports**  
   \- OCR transforms scanned PDFs into text-based documents that you can edit and analyze.

4. **Systematically scrub sensitive information (PII/PHI)**  
   \- Before sharing or processing documents with any AI tool, you must remove private or confidential information.

5. **Critically evaluate vocational expert reports using ChatBox and OpenAI’s GPT models**  
   \- ChatBox allows you to feed text to GPT models and receive an in-depth critique and insights.

6. **Engage in exploratory analysis and deep learning through interactive critique sessions**  
   \- By asking follow-up questions and refining prompts, you can deepen your understanding of vocational expert reports.

This guide aims to provide all necessary details so beginners can follow along, even if they have limited technical or legal experience.

### 3.3 OCR Processing with Adobe Acrobat Pro

1. **Install and Open Acrobat Pro**  
   - Use the link provided in the prerequisites. Even if you have the trial version, you can still perform OCR on your PDF documents.

2. **Open the Vocational Expert Report (PDF)**  
   - Click `File → Open` in Acrobat Pro.  
   - Select the PDF containing the vocational expert report.

3. **Perform OCR**  
   - Select `Tools → Scan & OCR` from Acrobat’s main toolbar.  
   - Click **"Recognize Text"** and ensure the option is set to “In This File.”  
   - Choose the appropriate language (e.g., English).  
   - Click **"Recognize Text"** or **"OK"** to start the OCR process.  
   - Wait for Acrobat to process each page. This may take a few minutes depending on the size and quality of the PDF.

4. **Export to Word**  
   - After OCR completes, go to `File → Export To → Microsoft Word (.docx)`.  
   - Choose a location on your computer to save this Word document, for instance in a folder named `OCR_Documents`.

> **How Does OCR Help?**  
> Scanned PDFs are essentially images, meaning you can’t easily select or edit text. OCR “reads” the image and converts it into editable text so you can refine and analyze it later.

### 3.4 Removing Sensitive Information in Microsoft Word

1. **Open the OCR’d Document in Microsoft Word**  
   - Launch Word, then go to `File → Open` and find the `.docx` file you just exported.  

2. **Use “Find & Replace” to Redact Confidential Data**  
   - Press `Ctrl + H` (Windows) or `Cmd + H` (macOS) to open the Find & Replace panel.  
   - In the **“Find what”** box, type the sensitive information you want to locate (e.g., full names, addresses, phone numbers).  
   - In the **“Replace with”** box, use placeholders like `[NAME REDACTED]` or `[ADDRESS REDACTED]`.  
   - Carefully proceed through each instance to ensure you do not inadvertently remove information that is not actually sensitive.

3. **Redact Other Identifiable Information**  
   - Look for additional data such as:  
     - Dates of birth → Replace with `[DATE REDACTED]`  
     - Case numbers → Replace with `[CASE NUMBER REDACTED]`  
     - Specific medical diagnoses → Replace with `[MEDICAL INFO REDACTED]` (only if required)  

4. **Manual Review**  
   - After using Find & Replace, read through the entire document to confirm you have not missed any hidden or repeated data.  
   - Ensure you maintain enough context to understand the report’s substance—be cautious not to remove critical vocational or medical elements essential for analysis.

5. **Save the Cleaned File**  
   - Once you are confident the document is scrubbed, save it under a clear name like `Report_Cleaned.docx`, possibly in a folder named `Cleaned_Documents`.

> **Why Is Redaction Important?**  
> Regulations like HIPAA (for healthcare in the U.S.) and other privacy laws require you to protect personal or confidential data. Proper redaction ensures compliance and prevents legal or ethical breaches.

### 3.5 Systematic and Detailed Critique Using ChatBox

1. **Open a New Chat in ChatBox**  
   - In the ChatBox interface, click **“New Chat”** or a similar button indicating you want to start a fresh conversation.

2. **Paste Your Sanitized Report**  
   - Copy the text from your cleaned `.docx` file and paste it directly into ChatBox, or attach it if ChatBox offers an attachment feature.  
   - Double-check you are using the sanitized version without personal identifiers.

3. **Provide a Specific Prompt**  
   - Clearly instruct the AI about the type of critique you want. For example:
     ```
     Please systematically critique the following Vocational Expert Report. Evaluate:
     1. Methodological accuracy
     2. Consistency and validity of vocational opinions
     3. Adequacy and appropriateness of labor market research data
     4. Clarity and completeness in defining vocational limitations and employability
     5. Any logical inconsistencies or methodological errors

     Then, provide structured recommendations for improvements and further exploration.

     ```

4. **Review the AI’s Feedback**  
   - ChatBox (via OpenAI’s GPT models) will provide a detailed critique.  
   - Consider asking follow-up questions such as “Could you elaborate on the labor market research issues you identified?” to dig deeper.

5. **Iterate and Refine**  
   - Rerun or adjust your prompts for more details or clarity if needed. AI tools often respond best to specific, context-rich prompts.

> **Remember**: The AI is a powerful tool but not an infallible authority. Use its critique to supplement your own professional judgment or the guidance of an expert in vocational analysis.

## Interactive Learning Session Suggestions

To deepen your understanding and extract maximum value from the AI tool, try adding these follow-up prompts:

- **“List the strongest aspects of the vocational methodology in this report.”**  
- **“Identify possible sources of bias in the vocational conclusions.”**  
- **“Suggest additional data or resources that could strengthen the report’s findings.”**  
- **“Compare this report to standard vocational guidelines and best practices.”**

By iterating different questions, you can explore the content from multiple angles and learn more about vocational expert reports’ nuances and complexities.

## Recommended File Organization

Maintaining an orderly folder structure can save time and confusion, especially when dealing with multiple reports. A sample layout:

```
Vocational_Report_Project/
├─ Original_PDFs/
│   └─ Original_Vocational_Report.pdf
├─ OCR_Documents/
│   └─ Report_OCR.docx
├─ Cleaned_Documents/
│   └─ Report_Cleaned.docx
└─ ChatBox_Critiques/
    └─ Report_Critique_Analysis.docx
```

- **Original_PDFs**: Contains the untouched PDFs.  
- **OCR_Documents**: Holds any `.docx` versions generated via OCR.  
- **Cleaned_Documents**: Has the sanitized versions with redacted info.  
- **ChatBox_Critiques**: Stores ChatBox output or transcripts from your analysis sessions.

This approach ensures you can trace your steps from the original PDF to the final critique.
